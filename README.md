# define-a-number-via-mnist-dataset
I start to work with neural networks. I think it's kinda fun.<br/>
This project has been created via JS and some framework: math.js(multiply matrices) and mnist(for convenient loading a data)<br/>
This precalibrated neural network gives 94.4% in test.<br/>
It's my first 3 layers(1 inp, 1 hid, 1 out) neural network. It's really simple network.<br/>
All info you can search in internet. I used a pdf file, Make Your Own Neural Network(you can find it easily).<br/>
Have a good one!<br/>
